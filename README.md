# Hi, I'm Aman Chourasia

I think about big ideas and wonder how things work and why they happen and then I try to turn those thoughts into simple plans I can understand and follow I use numbers drawings computers and experiments to help me see if my ideas make sense and what they do in the real world I do not think much about subjects or labels I just pick the tools that help me learn the most and answer my questions when something does not work I try again and change my idea and learn from it I like watching my thoughts slowly become real things I can test and touch and improve over time I care about making things that do something useful even if they start small or imperfect and I know it is okay not to finish everything because learning is part of the work this page shows the things I am playing with thinking about and building as I grow understand more and try to make the world a little clearer and better step by step.

<!--Hoiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii bru.
Ooo so you got my GitHub, yesssssssssssssssss 

I do not know how you landed here (tell me plox), but now that you are in, welcome to my digital lair. Maybe you were stalking me 👀, maybe GitHub’s algorithm betrayed me, or maybe it was just fate. Either way, hoiiiiiiii bru. Yes, this is me. Existing. Typing. Vibing.

Now do not expect some over-optimized README with 10 badges, 5 side projects, and a motivational quote about hustle. No no noi. This is real, raw, and slightly unhinged. I know where to put what, what to build. It is all a process of Maya. Mostly trial. Plenty of error.

You might find some random code here. Or an unfinished project. Or a finished project too 👀. That is just how it is. If you giggle or smile, good. If you remember me, even better. If you miss me bru, remember I also missed you bru.

You found my GitHub, you W. Now its time to, spend time with your loved ones. Or go to the temple. Or just smile and focus on what you need to do. Either way, thanks for stopping by, bru.

Radhe Radhe.-->
