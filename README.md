Hoiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii bru.
Ooo so you got my GitHub, yesssssssssssssssss 

I do not know how you landed here (tell me plox), but now that you are in, welcome to my digital lair. Maybe you were stalking me 👀, maybe GitHub’s algorithm betrayed me, or maybe it was just fate. Either way, hoiiiiiiii bru. Yes, this is me. Existing. Typing. Vibing.

Now do not expect some over-optimized README with 10 badges, 5 side projects, and a motivational quote about hustle. No no noi. This is real, raw, and slightly unhinged. I know where to put what, what to build. It is all a process of Maya. Mostly trial. Plenty of error.

You might find some random code here. Or an unfinished project. Or a finished project too 👀. That is just how it is. If you giggle or smile, good. If you remember me, even better. If you miss me bru, remember I also missed you bru.

You found my GitHub, you W. Now its time to, spend time with your loved ones. Or go to the temple. Or just smile and focus on what you need to do. Either way, thanks for stopping by, bru.

Radhe Radhe.
