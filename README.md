Hoiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii bru.
Ooo so you got my GitHub, yesssssssssssssssss 

I donâ€™t know how you landed here, but now that youâ€™re in, welcome to my digital lair of... mostly nothing (yet). Maybe you were stalking me ðŸ‘€, maybe GitHubâ€™s algorithm betrayed me, or maybe it was just fate. Either way, hoiiiiiiii bru. Yes, this is me. Existing. Typing. Vibing.

Now do not expect some over-optimized README with 10 badges, 5 side projects, and a motivational quote about hustle. No no noi. This is real, raw, and slightly unhinged. Iâ€™m still figuring out where to put what, what to build, and when to pretend I know Git properly. Itâ€™s all a process. Mostly trial. Plenty of error.

You might find some random code here. Or an unfinished project. Or a finished project too ðŸ‘€. That is just how it is. If you giggle or smile, good. If you remember me, even better. If you miss me bru, remember I also missed you bru.

You found my GitHub, you W. Now go, spend time with your loved ones. Or go to the temple. Or just smile and focus on what you need to do. Either way, thanks for stopping by, bru.
