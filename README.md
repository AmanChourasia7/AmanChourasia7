# Hoiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii bru 👋  

Ooo so you found my GitHub, yesssssssssssssssss 🚀  

I do not know how you landed here (tell me plox), but now that you are in, **welcome to my digital lair.**  
Maybe you were stalking me 👀, maybe GitHub’s algorithm betrayed me, or maybe it was just fate.  
Either way… *hoiiiiii bru.* Yes, this is me. Existing. Typing. Vibing.

### ✨ What you’ll find here
- Some random code 💻  
- An unfinished project (or five) 🛠️  
- Maybe even a finished project 👀  
- Definitely some chaos 🌪️  

This isn’t one of those “10 badges, 5 side projects, and a motivational hustle quote” type of READMEs.  
No no noi. This is real, raw, and slightly unhinged.  

I know where to put what.  
I know what to build.  
It’s all a process of *Maya.* Mostly trial. Plenty of error.

### 💭 If you’re here…
If you giggle or smile → good.  
If you remember me → even better.  
If you miss me bru → remember I also missed you bru.

### 🌸 Final words
You found my GitHub, you W.  
Now it’s time to…  
- Spend time with your loved ones ❤️  
- Go to the temple 🛕  
- Or just smile and focus on what you need to do 🌱  

Either way — thanks for stopping by, bru.  

**Radhe Radhe 🙏**
